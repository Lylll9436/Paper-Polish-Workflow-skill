## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.0 decisions preserved in `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`.

- Phase 11: AskUserQuestion enforcement is per-Skill audit, not blanket mandate
- Phase 11: Bilingual eligibility uses output_contract classification (7 eligible, 4 exempt)
- Phase 11: Batch mode added as AskUserQuestion exemption alongside direct mode
- [Phase 11]: AskUserQuestion enforcement is per-Skill audit, not blanket mandate
- [Phase 11]: Bilingual eligibility uses output_contract classification (7 eligible, 4 exempt)
- [Phase 11]: Batch mode added as AskUserQuestion exemption alongside direct mode
- [Phase 12]: Full rewrite (not incremental edit) due to pervasive structural differences from target skeleton
- [Phase 12]: Compressed from 348 to 193 lines while preserving all 15 workflow sub-operations
- [Phase 13]: Standardized on [Chinese] label (not [中文]) for Markdown blockquote bilingual output
- [Phase 13]: Paragraph markers REQUIRED for paragraph-level files, OPTIONAL for structured-output Skills
- [Phase 13]: Opt-out keywords are exact phrase matches: english only, no bilingual, only english, 不要中文
- [Phase 14]: Expanded repo-patterns.md with Skip Rules and directory indicator table for completeness (96 lines)
- [Phase 14]: Added Examples section to SKILL.md with full CEUS journal workflow demonstration
- [Phase 14]: Used auto-proceed (not hard checkpoint) for Step 1 scan summary
- [Phase 16]: Extracted generation rules to references/body-generation-rules.md to keep SKILL.md under 450 lines
- [Phase 16]: Moved journals/ceus.md from leaf_hints to required because Step 5 always needs CEUS formatting
- [Phase 16]: SKILL.md at 448 lines justified by 5-step complexity with generation rules already extracted to reference file

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Repo scan heuristics calibrated for Python ML projects only; non-Python repos may need pattern adjustments (Phase 14 risk)
- SKILL.md line budget for repo-to-paper estimated at ~320 lines after extraction; may need flexibility (Phase 14/16 risk)
- Semantic Scholar batch query performance at 20-30 calls untested (Phase 15 risk)
