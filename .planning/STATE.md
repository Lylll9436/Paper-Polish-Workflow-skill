# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Every Skill must produce output that is directly usable in a real paper submission
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Skill Conventions

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Skill Conventions)
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase
Status: Ready to discuss
Last activity: 2026-03-11 — Phase 1 completed and verified; ready to discuss Phase 2

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 47 min
- Total execution time: 1h 34m

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 1h 34m | 47 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02
- Trend: Initial phase complete

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (10 phases) splits foundation into references + conventions, core into 4 individual phases, sections into 2 groups, and support into one combined phase
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 (Translation and Polish) can execute in parallel after Phase 2 since they share no dependencies on each other
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (De-AI) explicitly depends on Phase 1 anti-AI patterns reference, not just Phase 2
- [Phase 01]: Stable overview path retained for expression references — Avoids breaking downstream Skills and public docs while enabling modular leaf files.
- [Phase 01]: Expression modules organized by writing scenario — Matches downstream retrieval patterns better than grammar-only grouping and keeps context narrower.
- [Phase 01]: CEUS path promoted to stable journal contract — Future Skills can target invariant headings without copying journal guidance into prompts.
- [Phase 01]: Anti-AI library grouped by category and risk tier — Supports lightweight retrieval today and richer De-AI explanation/rewrite flows later.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Polish Skill redesign approach (Phase 4) not yet defined — needs prototyping during planning
- Semantic Scholar MCP availability for Literature Skill (Phase 9) needs verification
- AskUserQuestion tool availability needs confirmation before building interactive Skills
