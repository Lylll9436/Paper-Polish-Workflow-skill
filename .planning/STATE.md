# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Every Skill must produce output that is directly usable in a real paper submission
**Current focus:** Phase 6: Reviewer Simulation Skill

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 10 (Reviewer Simulation Skill)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase 6 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — Phase 6 executed; reviewer simulation skill created

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 16 min
- Total execution time: 1h 53m

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 1h 34m | 47 min |
| 02 | 1 | 4m | 4 min |
| 03 | 1 | 3m | 3 min |
| 04 | 1 | 3m | 3 min |
| 05 | 1 | 4m | 4 min |
| 06 | 1 | 5m | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01, 03-01, 04-01, 05-01, 06-01
- Trend: Skill authoring phases complete quickly (markdown-only, no code)

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 07-abstract-and-experiment-skills P02 | 3 | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 07-abstract-and-experiment-skills P01 | 3 | 2 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (10 phases) splits foundation into references + conventions, core into 4 individual phases, sections into 2 groups, and support into one combined phase
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 (Translation and Polish) can execute in parallel after Phase 2 since they share no dependencies on each other
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (De-AI) explicitly depends on Phase 1 anti-AI patterns reference, not just Phase 2
- [Phase 01]: Stable overview path retained for expression references — Avoids breaking downstream Skills and public docs while enabling modular leaf files.
- [Phase 01]: Expression modules organized by writing scenario — Matches downstream retrieval patterns better than grammar-only grouping and keeps context narrower.
- [Phase 01]: CEUS path promoted to stable journal contract — Future Skills can target invariant headings without copying journal guidance into prompts.
- [Phase 01]: Anti-AI library grouped by category and risk tier — Supports lightweight retrieval today and richer De-AI explanation/rewrite flows later.
- [Phase 02]: Conventions and skeleton kept as separate linked files for independent copyability and maintenance
- [Phase 02]: Tools listed by capability category rather than vendor-specific names to prevent tool-name lock-in
- [Phase 02]: ~300 line hard budget with justification required for exceptions
- [Phase 02]: Four interaction modes defined: interactive, guided, direct, batch
- [Phase 03]: Default mode set to direct (single-pass) per user locked decision
- [Phase 03]: Journal template missing triggers refusal, not fallback to general style
- [Phase 03]: Anti-AI patterns loaded proactively during translation, not just post-processing
- [Phase 04]: LaTeX annotation format uses % [Polish] Original: prefix for cleanup-safe change tracking
- [Phase 04]: Guided mode described as shared pattern with step-specific table for line budget efficiency
- [Phase 04]: All three anti-AI pattern leaves loaded proactively (vocabulary, sentence-patterns, transitions-and-tone)
- [Phase 05]: Two-phase detect-then-rewrite workflow with user decision between phases (locked decision)
- [Phase 05]: Domain term protection uses dynamic context inference rather than hardcoded wordlist
- [Phase 05]: Optional-tier patterns flagged only when appearing 3+ times (repetition threshold)
- [Phase 05]: De-AI LaTeX annotation uses % [De-AI] Original: prefix, distinct from Polish Skill's % [Polish] Original:
- [Phase 06]: Chinese translation uses inline blockquote format after each concern, not appended section at end
- [Phase 06]: Anti-AI patterns NOT loaded by default -- review skill, not detection skill
- [Phase 06]: Batch mode unsupported since review requires full-paper context; direct mode only
- [Phase 06]: Report filename convention: {input_filename_without_ext}_review.md for file input
- [Phase 07]: Phase 2 requires Phase 1 confirmation — user cannot skip to discussion generation
- [Phase 07]: Literature connections use [CONNECT TO: ...] placeholders rather than AI-inferred citations (CLAUDE.md anti-hallucination principle)
- [Phase 07]: Evidence sentence must precede interpretation sentence in every Experiment Skill discussion paragraph
- [Phase 07]: Abstract Skill defaults to direct mode (single-pass) matching Phase 3 locked decision
- [Phase 07]: Restructure path flags missing formula positions with [MISSING: position-name] rather than silently dropping content
- [Phase 07]: Output always shows labeled formula version first then clean version after --- separator for verifiability

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Semantic Scholar MCP availability for Literature Skill (Phase 9) needs verification
- AskUserQuestion tool availability needs confirmation before building interactive Skills
